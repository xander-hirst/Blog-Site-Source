  <h1>Xander's Favorite Hero: Lone Druid</h1>
  <img src="images/lonedruid.jpeg" alt="Image of the hero Lone Druid" width="50%" height="50%">
  <p> Lone Druid is an agility hero that is usually played in the offlane as a position 3, though it is recently being played position 1 in the safelane</p>
  <p> He is a very unique hero due to his spirit bear ability, where Lone Druid controls a bear unit that scales with Lone Druid's level</p>
  <img src="images/ldandbear.png" alt="Image of Lone Druid and his spirit bear">
  <p> He is my favorite hero for a lot of reasons</p>
  <ul class="reasons">
    <li>Lone Druid is one of the few offlaners that can consistantly contest the enemy safelaner and support while he is solo</li>
    <li>There are a wide variety of effective item builds depending on how well you do in your lane</li>
    <li>It is easy to get solo kills in the beginning of the game, allowing you to snowball</li>
    <li>Microing the bear takes practice but it very rewarding once you get the hang of it</li>
    <li>Towards the later stages of the game, so long as you used your ult and are constantly attacking with both the bear and the hero, you are basically invincable</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>My ability build</h3>
  <img src="images/ldskillbuild.png" alt="Image of the skill build I usually go on Lone Druid">
  <p> You always want to max Summon Spirit Bear first because it gives the bear a lot of HP and damage early game</p>
  <p>Getting an early point in Savage Roar is useful and often will save your life as you try to run to safety when you get ganked</p>
  <h3>My item build</h3>
  <img src="images/lditembuild.png" alt="Image of the item build I usually go on Lone Druid">
  <p>If my lane is not going very well or if our team needs to win early game, then I will skip radiance and instead build Mask of Madness into Maelstrom</p>
