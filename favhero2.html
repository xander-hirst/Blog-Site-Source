    <h1>Jake's Favorite Hero: Earthshaker</h1>
<img src="images/earthshaker.jpg" alt="picture of earthshaker" width="50%" height="50%">
<p>Earthshaker is a strength, support hero usually known for his initiation type abilities. He is generally played as a position 4 hero,
however in the higher skilled brackets of the game, his versatility allows for him to be played as a core hero in the offlane.</p>
<img src="images/slam.png" alt="picture of earthshaker using his ultimate ability" width="40%" height="30%">
<p>There are many reasons why Earthshaker is my favorite hero, but here are just a few...</p>
<ul>
<li>His fissure ability is one of the best in the game, allowing Earthshaker to deal damage and stun an
enemy while blocking off a path. This is especially good when ganking the midlane, where blocking the entire hill allows for easy kills on the enemy midlaner.
 Not only this, but the incredibly long range of this spell allows for an amazing stun and significant damage to be utilized from far away.</li>
<li>Earthshaker is one of the best heros at swaying a teamfight. In particular, his ultimate ability coupled with a blink dagger
allows for devasating amounts of damage to be dealt if executed correctly. Plus it just looks cool.</li>
<li>Aside from the many things Earthshaker can do in game, the concept of the hero is very cool. The creators stress how powerful of a character he is, focusing all of his
skills specifically on controlling the earth beneath him.</li>
</ul>

<h3>My Ability Build</h3>

<p>Generally in the early game, you'll want to prioritize his fissure ability since it
proves to be an amazing disabler spell. This is his best spell.</p>

<h3>My Item Build</h3>

<p>There is a lot of directions you can take Earthshaker's build during all points of the game. Early game, you'll find
 that Earthshaker has very limited mana, so you'll either want to rush mana boots or get tranquil boots and a soul ring. Getting
 a blink dagger is almost always nice on Earthshaker, however depending on how your early game has gone, you might want to consider
 purchasing force staff as a cheaper alternative for your mobility item. Furthermore, if you already find yourself fully equip with the
  essentials, I usually highly reccommend purchasing a Eul's Sceptor, an incredibly good item, with many different uses.</p>
